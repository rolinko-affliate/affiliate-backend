echo "⏰ Expected Timeline:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "🚀 Phase 1: Domain Validation (5-15 minutes)"
echo "   • Google verifies you control the domain"
echo "   • Checks DNS points to the ingress IP"
echo "   • Validates HTTP/.well-known/acme-challenge path"
echo ""
echo "🔐 Phase 2: Certificate Generation (10-30 minutes)"
echo "   • Google generates the SSL certificate"
echo "   • Certificate is signed by Google Trust Services"
echo "   • Certificate is deployed to load balancer"
echo ""
echo "✅ Phase 3: Activation (1-5 minutes)"
echo "   • Certificate status changes to 'Active'"
echo "   • HTTPS becomes available"
echo "   • HTTP automatically redirects to HTTPS"
echo ""

echo "📈 Total Expected Time: 15-60 minutes"
echo "   • Typical: 20-30 minutes"
echo "   • Fast: 10-15 minutes (if everything is optimal)"
echo "   • Slow: 45-60 minutes (if there are delays)"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Success Indicators:"
echo "   ✅ DNS resolves correctly (already working)"
echo "   ✅ Ingress has stable IP (already working)"
echo "   ✅ HTTP responds (already working)"
echo "   ⏳ Certificate status: Provisioning → Active"
echo "   ⏳ HTTPS will start working"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Monitoring Commands:"
echo "   # Watch certificate status"
echo "   kubectl get managedcertificate affiliate-backend-ssl-cert -n saas-bff -w"
echo ""
echo "   # Check certificate details"
echo "   kubectl describe managedcertificate affiliate-backend-ssl-cert -n saas-bff"
echo ""
echo "   # Test HTTPS (once Active)"
echo "   curl -v https://api.affiliate.rolinko.com/health"
echo ""

echo "⚠️  Common Delays:"
echo "   • DNS propagation (usually not an issue since DNS is working)"
echo "   • Google's certificate authority load"
echo "   • First-time domain validation"
echo "   • Network connectivity issues"
echo ""

echo "🚨 If it takes longer than 60 minutes:"
echo "   • Check ingress events: kubectl get events -n saas-bff"
echo "   • Verify domain ownership"
echo "   • Check for conflicting certificates"
echo "   • Contact Google Cloud Support"
